 * maybe add sound output from teensy board
 * logging
     *  add log start/stop via IR
	 * add "remove all log files from SD" command
 * attitude/velo/pos/accBias estimation algorithm, based on IMU+encoder measurements
 * try PD regulator (positive feedback from $\omega$, not only from $\gamma$ .  )
 * how to estimate IMU<->robot calibration in motion?
